# Statistics Dojo! ðŸ¥·

## Welcome to the Statistics dojo!

So, you wish to master the martial art of STATISTIC do you?

Well, your training is about to begin...

You will face four challengers which will increase in difficulty.

_For all of the challenges below you must throw an error ("Must be an array of numbers") if the input is not an array and the array does not only contain numbers_

### -- Challenge One --

Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the mean (average) of those numbers.

** Example **<br>
`[10, 4, 6, 9, 20] --> 9.8`

### -- Challenge Two --

Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the median (the middle number in a sorted list of numbers) of those numbers.
If the array contains an even amount of numbers, it should return the average of the two middle numbers

** Example **<br>
`[10, 4, 6, 9, 20] --> 9`

### -- Challenge Three --

Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the range (difference between the highest and lowest number) of those numbers.

** Example **<br>
`[10, 4, 6, 9, 20] --> 16`

### -- Challenge Four --

Create a function that combines the work you've done above. It should take in an array of numbers and return an object that contains the
mean,median and range of those numbers

** Example **<br>
`[10, 4, 6, 9, 20] --> {
mean: 9.8,
median: 9,
range: 16
}`
